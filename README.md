# :dart: Snowflake_DataLoading & Analysis
### :small_orange_diamond: This repository contains scripts and information for loading data into Snowflake
###   a cloud-based data warehousing platform.
### The basic steps to load local data into snowflake:
1.Check the input source type of your Dataset.

2.Create & Run target table SQL Command.

3.Select database, schema and table

4.Load data into table

#### After we have the source input, let us check the data first:

ðŸ’  We should notice that there is a redundant header in the first line we will not use it. Also, the data format needs to be processed carefully, as there is no second suffix. The comma in a inner sentence should be isolated, it is not a delimiter anymore. All these works need to be done before we load data to table of database.

ðŸ’  The next step is to create the target table to Snowflake. We need to choose which one database and schema we want to upload. The constraints can be roughly used:

 We can see the Empty Table has been created on your selected Database and schema


ðŸ’  Now we have to Load Data Into the Table :

ðŸ’  Browse your dataset file :

ðŸ’  After selecting your file click on next:

ðŸ’  Select your File Formate, Header, Field optionally enclosed by, and other :

ðŸ’  See Data Preview:

ðŸ’  We can also use sql queries to check data using < Select * from > :

âœ… That's All. We managed to load the data from the local to Snowflake.

ðŸ“Š We can also do Analysis of our Data using snowflake charts and filters:
